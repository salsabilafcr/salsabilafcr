ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Salsabila Fachrina. I am a Chemical Engineering graduate who is passionate about the world of Data Analytics, driven by a belief in the importance of data-driven decision making. Through my experience in Full-Stack Data Analytics Bootcamp, I have honed my technical skills in Excel/Spreadsheet, SQL, and Python along with my problem-solving, detail-orientation, and analytical thinking skills enabling me to perform a wide range of analysis, from customer segmentation, customer retention, market basket analysis, correlation, regression, and event tracking analysis to gain valuable insights.

In addition, I have expertise in creating informative and interactive data visualizations using Tableau and Power BI. I believe that the skills and experience I have will enable me to make a significant contribution as a Professional Data Analyst. My desire to continuously learn and grow, coupled with my dedication to producing quality solutions, makes me confident that I can bring a great positive impact to the company.
